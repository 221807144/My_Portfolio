STAR Reflection:

Situation:
During my WIL internship at Plum Systems, I was responsible for submitting monthly timesheets accurately. In February 2025, after completing my timesheet, 
I needed to ensure that it reached my supervisor in a professional and timely manner. 
This was an important task because proper submission was essential for accurate record-keeping and for demonstrating my responsibility in the workplace.

Task:
My task was to communicate the submission of my timesheet clearly and professionally to my supervisor. 
I needed to ensure that the email was polite, concise, and included all necessary documents so that my supervisor could review and approve it without confusion.
Additionally, I had to document my weekly tasks and progress in a formal report for my mentor and university.

Action:
I drafted a professional email to my supervisor, Tashreeq, attaching the completed timesheet and register. 
I made sure my email was structured, polite, and clear, requesting that the documents be reviewed and signed at the earliest convenience. The email read:

Subject: Register and Report
To: tashreeq@plum.systems

Date: 2025-02-22 17:54

Dear Tashreeq,

I hope this email finds you well. Please find attached all the required reports and register. Could you kindly review and sign them at your earliest convenience?

Thank you for your assistance.

Kind regards,
Masibuve Sikhulume

In parallel, I compiled my weekly tasks and documented progress in a formal WIL report. I ensured that all activities,
achievements, and challenges were accurately recorded and submitted the report to my mentor and university in PDF format.

Result:
The email successfully communicated the submission, ensuring that my supervisor received and reviewed the timesheet promptly. 
My mentor also reviewed my WIL report and provided positive feedback, highlighting my ability to communicate professionally, document work accurately, 
and manage responsibilities effectively. This experience strengthened my written communication, attention to detail, and 
confidence in handling professional correspondence.
