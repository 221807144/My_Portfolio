**Situation:**  
As part of my Work Readiness Training during WIL at Plum Systems, I participated in a mock interview to strengthen my interview skills. This was designed to help me practice introducing myself, discussing my skills, and handling questions about teamwork, customer service, and technical abilities in a professional setting.  

**Task:**  
I needed to prepare structured responses to common interview questions, such as "Tell us more about yourself," "What makes you different?", "What is your biggest weakness?", and scenario-based questions about teamwork and customer service. My goal was to present myself confidently and professionally while clearly demonstrating my technical and interpersonal skills.  

**Action:**  
I reviewed my experience as a Full Stack Developer at Plum Systems, highlighting my work with Java, Spring Boot, React, and MySQL. I prepared answers emphasizing my adaptability, problem-solving mindset, teamwork experience, and ability to manage multiple tasks effectively. I practiced these responses, participated in the mock interview, and applied feedback to improve clarity, tone, and body language. I also reflected on past projects, client interactions, and my approach to task prioritization to provide strong examples.  

**Result:**  
The mock interview improved my confidence in presenting myself professionally and articulating my skills and experience. I became better at linking my academic knowledge and professional experience to interview questions. Additionally, I strengthened my ability to communicate technical concepts, handle difficult scenarios, and showcase my problem-solving and teamwork abilities effectively.
