[Watch Mock Interview](../evidence/Mock%20Interview/Mock%20Interview.mp4)

**Situation:**  
As part of my work readiness training, I recorded a mock interview to simulate a real IT job interview. The purpose was to practice answering personality, technical, behavioral, and opinion-based questions professionally and confidently.  

**Task:**  
I needed to demonstrate clear communication, professionalism, and confidence while responding to questions about my skills, education, teamwork, problem-solving, and technical knowledge.  

**Action:**  
I prepared by reviewing common interview questions and structuring my responses. During the recording, I maintained positive body language, clear speech, and organized answers. I answered questions such as:  
- **Personality:** "Tell me about yourself" – I introduced myself, highlighted my studies in ICT at CPUT, and discussed my internship experience.  
- **Abilities:** "What software/systems are you familiar with?" – I mentioned Java, Python, and React.  
- **Qualification-based:** "What's the highest level of education completed?" – I shared that I completed Grade 12 and am pursuing a Diploma in ICT.  
- **Behavioral:** "Tell me about a time you conflicted with a colleague" – I described resolving a disagreement in a group project through active listening and compromise.  
- **Technical:** "What tools do you use to diagnose problems?" – I listed debuggers, log analyzers, IDEs like IntelliJ and VS Code, JUnit, and browser developer tools.  
- **Opinion-based:** "Can conflict be healthy in the workplace?" – I explained that it encourages diverse ideas and innovation when managed properly.  
- **Brainteaser:** "Probability of rolling a sum of 10 with two dice?" – I calculated 3/36 based on possible outcomes.  

After recording, I reviewed the video to identify areas for improvement, such as tone, clarity, and body language.  

**Result:**  
The mock interview video helped me improve my confidence, refine my answers, and better present my internship and technical experience. It strengthened my professional communication skills and prepared me effectively for real interviews.
